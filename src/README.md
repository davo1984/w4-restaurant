# Assignment

    Generate the following information:
        The restaurant's name (give it a good one!)
        The restaurant's address
        The restaurant's hours of operation

    Access the API using Axios.

    Create a dynamic restaurant menu
        Must include at least five sections for unique meal type (appetizers, lunch, main course, sides, dessert, etc) with unique food items
        One meal section must have at least 15 unique items, and 3 other different meal sections must have at least 8 unique items each. (think 15 main courses, 10 appetizers, 1 special, 8 sides, etc)
        Since the api generates random foods, you do not need to sort the foods, as long as you are display them in their unique sections (imagine this restaurant exists in a parallel universe where people eat whatever, whenever)
        A price for the food item
        Each Menu Section must be viewable separately in an organism (for example, a bootstrap accordion or nav tabs)
        Each menu item must be an molecule (for example, using a bootstrap card with a picture of the meal, as well as the name, and the price, etc)

    Manage the React Component State

    Each time you access the API, you get a different menu. Use React Lifecycle Methods to save the results in local storage so that every time your website is accessed, the user gets the same menu (Different users will see different menus; that's okay). Make sure if you delete local storage, you retrieve a new menu from the API

# Additional Requirements

    Website must be responsive
    Website must be styled
    Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the Class Resources Repo.
    Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
        Remember to push to GitHub!
        Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

# Stretch Goals

    Create an MVP assigning points to user stories using the fibonacci method
    Use React-Bootstrap or reactstrap for styling. See Recommended NPM Installs
    Modify your Title and Meta Tags using create-react-app
    Use NPM to embed a Google Map component showing the location of the restaurant.
    Include a different 'specials' menu for each day of the week that the restaurant is open and show that menu based on the current day (should prove to work throughout the week) as well as what was on the specials menu yesterday/ what will be on the specials menu tomorrow
    Use React Context
    Make each menu type (appetizers, main course, etc ) be the correct foods instead of random using filtering and natural language parsing
    Parse the results of the API call to show a list of sides available for substitution (either in addition to or instead of listing sides with each entree).
    Implement DoorDash style online ordering with parent-child component state management and a 'shopping cart' to save data for purchase
    Write React Tests with create-react-app
    Use Redux state
    Push to Firebase
